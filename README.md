# OpenRice Data Mining project
For detail information, please kindly visit my personal web site www.mlact.com (in chinese only).

### The purpose of this project is to learn webscraping and text mining through a famous food critics web site.

### The first to be done will be building a webscraper to extract restaurant detail, comment and rating information.  Then I will use text mining algorithm to analyze the comment as well as using machine learning method for clustering and prediction.

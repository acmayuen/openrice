# openrice data mining project
## The purpose of this project is to learn webscraping and text mining through a famous food critics web site.

## The first to be done will be building a webscraper to extract restaurant detail, comment and rating information.  Then I will use text mining algorithm to analyze the comment as well as using machine learning method for clustering and prediction.
